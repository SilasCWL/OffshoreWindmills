ReadMe - Offshore Windmill project, Github: https://github.com/SilasCWL/OffshoreWindmills.git

To replicate my setup, create a folder called "cds-spatial-finalproject" in documents on your computer. 
Next, download and place the contents of this repo into the folder.
Fetch the data, uploaded on sciencedata.dk from this link: https://sciencedata.dk/shared/cd5f9fac0ddbea3e83ede8bcb55d916e 
Download it and place it into the R project, in the folder Windmill_Depth_CDSSpatial and unzip it. 
The structure should look like this: documents/cds-spatial-finalproject/Windmill_Depth_CDSSpatial/data
Now you're good to go.
