## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

```{r}
library(terra)

# Load the NetCDF file
vind_nc <- "data/DMI_Klimaatlas_v2024b_Grid_Middelvind_absolut.nc"
r <- rast(vind_nc)

# Check metadata and layers
print(r)
names(r)
plot(r[[1]])  # Plot the first layer

```
